===============================================================================
Introduction
===============================================================================

This project provides a full, high performance, portable implementation of the
ARMCI runtime system using MPI's remote memory access (RMA) functionality.

===============================================================================
Installing Only ARMCI-MPI
===============================================================================

ARMCI-MPI uses autoconf and must be configured before compiling:

 $ ./configure

Many configure options are provided, run "configure --help" for details.  After
configuring the source tree, the code can be built and installed by running:

 $ make && make install

The quality of MPI-RMA implementations varies.  As of August, 2011 the
following MPI-2 implementations are known to work correctly with ARMCI-MPI:

 + MVAPICH2 1.6
 + MPICH2
 + Cray MPI on Cray XE6
 + IBM MPI on BG/P (set ARMCI_STRIDED_METHOD=IOV and ARMCI_IOV_METHOD=BATCHED)
 + OpenMPI 1.5.4 (set ARMCI_STRIDED_METHOD=IOV and ARMCI_IOV_METHOD=BATCHED)

The following MPI-2 implementations are known to fail with ARMCI-MPI:

 - MVAPICH2 prior to 1.6

As of April 2014, the following MPI-3 implementations are know to work correctly
with ARMCI-MPI (mpi3rma branch):

 + MPICH 3.0.4 and later on Mac, Linux SMPs and SGI SMPs.
 + MVAPICH2 2.0a and later on Linux InfiniBand clusters.
 + CrayMPI 6.1.0 and later on Cray XC30.
 + SGI MPT 2.09 on SGI SMPs.
 + OpenMPI development version on Mac (set ARMCI_STRIDED_METHOD=IOV and ARMCI_IOV_METHOD=BATCHED)

===============================================================================
Installing Global Arrays with ARMCI-MPI
===============================================================================

ARMCI-MPI2 has been tested with GA 5.0.2.  To build GA with ARMCI-MPI2, rename
this directory to "armci" and substitute it for the "armci" directory in the GA
distribution.  Configure and build GA as usual; no special flags are required.

To build GA 5.2 with ARMCI-MPI (any version), use the configure option
--with-armci=$(PATH_TO_ARMCI_MPI) and make sure that you use the same MPI
implementation with GA that was used to compile ARMCI-MPI.

ARMCI-MPI3 has been tested extensively with GA 5.2 and 5.3.

===============================================================================
The ARMCI-MPI Test Suite
===============================================================================

ARMCI-MPI includes a set of testing and benchmark programs located under tests/
and benchmarks/.  These programs can be compiled and run via:

$ make check MPIEXEC="mpiexec -n 4"

The MPIEXEC variable is optional and is used to override the default MPI launch
command.  If you want only to build the test suite, the following target can be
used:

$ make checkprogs

===============================================================================
ARMCI-MPI Errata
===============================================================================

Direct access to local buffers:

 * Because of MPI-2's semantics, you are not allowed to access shared memory
   directly, it must be through put/get.  Alternatively you can use the
   new ARMCI_Access_begin/end() functions.

 * MPI-3 allows direct access provided one uses a synchronization operation
   afterwards.  The ARMCI_Access_begin/end() functions are also valid.

Progress semantics:

 * On some MPI implementations and networks you may need to enable implicit
   progress.  In many cases this is done through an environment variable.  For
   MPICH2: set MPICH_ASYNC_PROGRESS; for MVAPICH2 recompile with
   --enable-async-progress and set MPICH_ASYNC_PROGRESS; set DCMF_INTERRUPTS=1
   for MPI on BGP; etc.

See https://github.com/jeffhammond/HPCInfo/wiki/MPI#Asynchronous_Progress for
more information on activating asynchronous progress in MPI.  However, we find
that most platforms show no improvement and often a decrease in performance,
provided the application makes calls to GA/ARMCI/MPI frequently enough on all
processes.

===============================================================================
Environment Variables:
===============================================================================

Boolean environment variables are enabled when set to a value beginning with
't', 'T', 'y', 'Y', or '1'; any other value is interpreted as false.

 -------------------
: Debugging Options :
 -------------------

ARMCI_VERBOSE (boolean)

  Enable extra status output from ARMCI-MPI.

ARMCI_DEBUG_ALLOC (boolean)

  Turn on extra shared allocation debugging.

ARMCI_FLUSH_BARRIERS (boolean) (deprecated)

  Enable/disable extra communication flushing in ARMCI_Barrier.  Extra flushes
  are present to help make unsafe DLA safer.  (This option is deprecated with
  the ARMCI-MPI3 implementation.)

 ---------------------
: Performance Options :
 ---------------------

ARMCI_CACHE_RANK_TRANSLATION (boolean)

  Create a table to more quickly translate between absolute and group ranks.

ARMCI_PROGRESS_THREAD (boolean)

  Create a Pthread to poke the MPI progress engine.

ARMCI_PROGRESS_USLEEP (int)

  Argument to usleep() to pause the progress polling loop.

 --------------------------
: Noncollective Groups     :
 --------------------------

ARMCI_NONCOLLECTIVE_GROUPS (boolean)

  Enable noncollective ARMCI group formation; group creation is collective on
  the output group rather than the parent group.

 --------------------------
: Shared Buffer Protection :
 --------------------------

ARMCI_SHR_BUF_METHOD = { COPY (default), NOGUARD }

  ARMCI policy for managing shared origin buffers in communication operations:
  lock the buffer (unsafe, but fast), copy the buffer (safe), or don't guard
  the buffer - assume that the system is cache coherent and MPI supports
  unlocked load/store.

 --------------------
: I/O Vector Options :
 --------------------

ARMCI_IOV_METHOD = { AUTO (default), CONSRV, BATCHED, DIRECT }

  Select the IO vector communication strategy: automatic; a "conservative"
  implementation that does lock/unlock around each operation; an implementation
  that issues batches of operations within a single lock/unlock epoch; and a
  direct implementation that generates datatypes for the origin and target and
  issues a single operation using them.

ARMCI_IOV_CHECKS (boolean)

  Enable (expensive) IOV safety/debugging checks (not recommended for
  performance runs).

ARMCI_IOV_BATCHED_LIMIT = { 0 (default), 1, ... }

  Set the maximum number of one-sided operations per epoch for the BATCHED IOV
  method.  Zero (default) is unlimited.

 -----------------
: Strided Options :
 -----------------

ARMCI_STRIDED_METHOD = { DIRECT (default), IOV }

  Select the method for processing strided operations.
